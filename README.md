# Chuck-Norris-Jokes
A fun mini project by Traversy Media that displays Chuck Norris jokes from an open source API (https://www.icndb.com/api/). This project was meant to demonstarte the use of an external api, creating an object and parsing that json data to pull a single or multiple joke (based on user's input) and display it in the dom. I enjoy doing fun mini projects such as this because it brings me back to the fundamentals.
